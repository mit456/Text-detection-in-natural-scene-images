# Text-detection-in-natural-scene-images
Devanagari text detection in images. This is a simple approach to extract devanagari text detection from natural scene images. I've used CNN 
and connected component labelling to extract the text from images. This approach is language agnostic and depending on the training set used it can be applied to any language.
